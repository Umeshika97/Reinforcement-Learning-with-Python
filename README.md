# Reinforcement-Learning-with-Python
The main purpose of this assignment was to do coding for Reinforcement Learning with Python.  The main objective of this assignment was to gain brief knowledge about Reinforcement Learning  with Python.

In this experiment was included three parts which are practical the given 
code example, modelling the discussed example problem in the lecture note using Python and 
compare the output and results in Octave verse Python. And the third part was answered by 
modelling the Exercise problem of maze solving given in the lecture note. Jupiter notebook and 
Octave were used to analyze output and results. This software reduces the errors involved in 
experimenting as compared to those performed manually. This is because Colab notebook and 
Octave which lead to high precision and accuracy in the results obtained while analyzing outputs. 
In conclusion, Q-learning appears to be an intriguing idea and maybe considerably more 
entrancing than customary directed Artificial Intelligent since for this situation the machine is 
essentially gaining without any preparation how to play out a specific undertaking to enhance 
potential compensations
